# v0 MCP Server Project Overview

## Project Goal
Create an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates v0.dev's official API with Claude Code, enabling Claude Code to generate high-quality React/Next.js UI components by leveraging v0's superior UI generation capabilities.

## Problem Statement
Claude Code has weak UI generation capabilities compared to v0.dev. This MCP server bridges that gap by:
- Allowing Claude Code to delegate UI creation tasks to v0.dev
- Providing structured communication between Claude Code and v0
- Handling the complexity of v0 API integration
- Ensuring generated components integrate seamlessly with existing codebases

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components
1. **v0 MCP Server** - FastMCP-based server using v0.dev official API
2. **Communication Protocol** - Structured request/response format
3. **Integration Rules** - CLAUDE.md configuration for behavior governance
4. **Component Management** - Handles UI component generation and integration

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: FastMCP (TypeScript)
- **v0 Integration**: Official v0.dev API (https://api.v0.dev/v1)
- **AI SDK**: Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI compatibility
- **Schema Validation**: Zod
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+

## Key Features

### 1. Official v0 API Integration
- Uses v0.dev's official API (not web scraping)
- OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- Supports streaming responses
- Multimodal input (text + images)

### 2. Structured Communication
- Standardized request/response format
- Component analysis and generation phases
- Integration guidance and dependency management
- Error handling and iteration limits

### 3. Smart Component Management
- Build order recommendations
- Dependency analysis
- Integration instructions
- File structure guidance

### 4. Design System Compatibility
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS focused
- Next.js App Router optimized
- TypeScript-first approach
- Accessibility built-in

## Project Status
- ‚úÖ Concept and architecture defined
- ‚úÖ Communication protocol designed
- ‚úÖ API integration approach planned
- ‚úÖ Documentation created
- üîÑ Implementation in progress
- ‚è≥ Testing and refinement pending
- ‚è≥ Production deployment pending

## Next Steps for Implementation
1. Set up basic FastMCP server structure
2. Implement v0 API client integration
3. Create request/response handlers
4. Add component analysis logic
5. Implement iteration and error handling
6. Create comprehensive tests
7. Write deployment documentation

## Success Metrics
- Claude Code can successfully generate UI components via v0
- Generated components integrate cleanly with existing codebases
- Response times under 10 seconds for simple components
- 90%+ success rate for component generation requests
- Clear error messages and fallback handling
